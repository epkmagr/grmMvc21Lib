            <h3>Introduktion</h3>
            <p>Här har jag analyserat min kodkvalitet på denna webbplatsen.
            Ett av verktygen (phpmetrics) har jag installerat och kört lokalt i min
            utvecklingsmiljö. Det andra verktyget (Scrutinizer CI) är en extern
            byggtjänst som kopplar sig mot mitt repo på GitHub/GitLab.</p>

            <p><strong>Coverage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lines, files, classes, methods covered by one or several test cases.</li>
                <li>Higher coverage could imply that the code is well tested.</li>
                <li>Low coverage could imply potential risk in quality assurance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Complexity</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The higher the value the more complex the code might be resulting in
                harder to maintain and develop.</li>
                <li>A lot of nested loops and conditions.</li>
                <li>Recommended 10.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Cohesion</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower values indicates focused classes with single responsibilities
                which gives "high cohesion" where the methods really belong to the class.</li>
                <li>A higher value (low cohesion) might indicate a class with many
                responsibilities that can be divided into several classes.</li>
                <li>Try to aim for lower values. That is high cohesion supporting single
                responsibility.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Coupling</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Afferent coupling (AC) is the number of classes affected by given
                class. => Outgoing connections</li>
                <li>Efferent coupling (EC) is the number of classes from which given
                class receives effects. => Incoming connections</li>
                <li>High number of AC (outgoing) might say that this class uses many
                other classes.</li>
                <li>High number of EC (incoming) might say that many other classes
                depends on this class.</li>

            <h4>Observations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> Not included in this measurements.</li>
                <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Average relative System complexity is 57.28
                - Feels too high. Average weighted method count by class (CC) 8.22 - Feels ok.</li>
                <li><strong>Cohesion:</strong> Lack of cohesion of methods (LCOM) is 1.37.
                BookRepository, Card and Deck has LCOM 2 and Userository has LCOM 3.
                Feel ok.</li>
                <li><strong>Coupling:</strong> Card and Deck has AC 5. CardHand has AC 2. Feels ok.
                Card has EC 0 and Deck and CardHand has EC 1. Feels ok.</li>
                <li>Average defects by class (Kan) is 0.38 but CardHand has 0.75, Game21
                1.4 and Deck 0.61. Perhaps something to improve?</li>
                <li>I do not like that the number of violations is 7. I want to reduce
                them.</li>
